                <div><h1>Global Job web-site</h1></div>
                <p class="uxwords">I have thought that it would be convenient and nice to have a site like this site. This is where people in various professions, beyond academic background, gender, and race, post their thoughts and lives or are interviewed and then post their writings and videos. Main will be posted for videos of the people with various occupations, and the next section will show the postings covering such people or articles written by themselves. At the bottom, there will be real-time spaces where people from different countries can find different jobs and talk about each other's jobs. The menu is also created simply by pressing a tab looking like a sticker at the top. You can easily search for a job by using search.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, the easiest feature here is the login feature. There are many sites where you must log in to write, but here is the place where you can write even if you don't log in. You can also easily find what you wrote later. In addition, the questions that people are wondering are being left open to ask at any time. Talented people in each profession can answer in real time quickly.</p>

            <div><h1>A Restaurant Application<br>MockUp WireFrame</h1></div>
            <p class="uxwords">This wire frame was designed to ease students' discomfort when using the market. It is an application that takes a bar code and pays online or receives a number and waits for their turn.</p>

            <div><h1>Ticket<br> web-site</h1></div>
            <p class="uxwords">This is a ticket site. It will be almost the site that encompasses entertainment.  The first screen will have entertainment videos. Social media is also active, these days, so it will be on the main so that users can see it right away.
                <br><br>
                In addition, when paying for a ticket, you always had to click on several processes to see the purchase. So I created the ticket section out to solve the problem and see easily anytime. The big advantage of this site is that you can pay for your ticket anytime, anywhere on any pages. I think it is revolutionary.</p>

            <div><h1>Piano<br> practicing<br> App</h1></div>
            <p class="uxwords">This is the application for practicing the piano. You can also find video lessons and search for songs at each level to see music scores. You can also find the scores with only a click on what the music key is and how many keys you need. You can search for songs of various genres and participate in contests.
                <br><br>
                The biggest strength of this application is that it can listen to the melodies that users make and the application will easily find the scores. This music application will be developed little by little more.</p>
